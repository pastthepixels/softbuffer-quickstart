Softbuffer Quickstart
=====================
A wrapper that makes using Softbuffer as easy as using minifb.

Running the Softbuffer example in softbuffer-quickstart:
```rust
use softbuffer_quickstart::{SoftbufferWindow, WindowProperties};

fn main() {
    let mut window = SoftbufferWindow::new(
        // This is the "loop closure" -- called on every update loop
        |window, buffer| {
            let (width, height) = {
                let size = window.inner_size();
                (size.width, size.height)
            };
            for index in 0..(width * height) {
                let y = index / width;
                let x = index % width;
                let red = x % 255;
                let green = y % 255;
                let blue = (255 - (red + green).min(255)) % 255;

                buffer[index as usize] = blue | (green << 8) | (red << 16);
            }
        },
        // This is how we can set properties for the window when it's initially created.
        WindowProperties::default()
    );
    window.run().expect("window can't run :(");
}
```


## Contributing
PRs are welcome! As with any of my other projects it might take a while for me to respond to issues/pull requests. I recommend not squashing your commits before you submit a PR as doing so makes it a bit harder to review your code.  
I'm looking for any ways to boost performance as much as possible while making the library simpler and more intuitive.

## Ideas:
- Handling Winit events (like resizing)
- Improving performance with the buffer (for loops in general are slow! there has to be a faster way to iterate over everything in the buffer)
- Adding icons to WindowProperties (probably good for new contributors)
